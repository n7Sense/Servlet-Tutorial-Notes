What does J2EE comprise?
==========================
J2EE is comprised of many APIs that can be used to build enterprise applications. Although the total list of APIs initially 
seems overwhelming, it is worth bearing in mind that some are primarily used by the J2EE environment in which your application
executes, while some provide services that your specific application may not require. Therefore, it is worth remembering that you
 don't have to use all of them in order to build J2EE applications. For completeness, however, the full list of technologies 
 that make up J2EE is as follows:

		Java Servlets
		JavaServer Pages (JSP)
		Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)
		Java Message Service (JMS)
		Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)
		Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)
		JavaMail
		Java Transaction Service (JTS)
		Java Transaction API (JTA)
		J2EE Connector Architecture (J2EE-CA, or JCA)

From a developer perspective, the main technologies are EJB, JSP, Java Servlets, JDBC and JMS, although JNDI is used for 
locating EJBs and other enterprise resources. For the moment, let's take a quick look at some of these technologies 
before moving on to see how to get started with J2EE.
