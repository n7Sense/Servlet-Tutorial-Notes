6.Private Methods Inside Interface*
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Before Jdk 1.7 is Fully Abstracte

But In 1.8{
	//can contain
	i.default Methods
	ii.static Methods
	}

But in 1.9{
	//can contain
	i.Private Methods
}

Default Methods: without effecting implementation Classes we can add new method to the interface
Private Methods: The main purpose of Private Methods inside interface is Code Re-Usability, without effecting implementation classes if want reusability
