HTTP/2 Client
+++++++++++++++++++++

before Java 9 to communicate in Network for Request and Response we use HttpUrl, which is very dificult
HttpUrlConnection (in 1997)
	Difficult to use
	At a time onle onew Request (i.e Synchronized)
	Tex oriented
	Blocking Mode

Then we are use 3rt party api i.e  Apache HttpClient Or GoogleHttpClient

But in Java9 the new features HttP/2 Client
all problems are solved
